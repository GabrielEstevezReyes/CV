A peak at my work

Since you are already here, please read this lines.

This repository is new, before this, I only worked on repositories that belog to either other people or the studio that I currently work 
in.

Here you will find 3 main folders, a wider description of each one can be found bellow.

Hoover:
  This is a folder containing C# scripts, they were used for a shool project, as I was the only programmer, I did the scripts
  and my classmates did the assets, all that the scripts do is create a Hoover Ship that can adapt its rotation to the geometry below it.
  (Something like geometry wars, it uses raycast and planes to make the movement swift and enjoyable)
  
Unity Components:
  This folder is the result of many small C# scripts used to solve tiny problems on the projects I handle at work, there are many more
  not included that I did, but since they go with the Unity project to the buyer of the project I chose not to include them.
  
VideogamePhysics:
  This is a small library of components to simulate physics, it needs more changes as it lacks several features like iquids or joints.
  It is made in C++ and uses SDL for the window handling, right when you open the project and hit run you will see a small red dot
  falling into a cube, if you move the particle the cube will rotate depending on the force and location of the collition.
